# deep-code-security

Multi-language SAST tool with agentic verification and AI-powered fuzzing. Two analysis modes:
1. **Static Analysis (SAST)** - Uses tree-sitter for deterministic AST parsing, sandbox-verified exploit PoCs, and structured remediation guidance
2. **Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing)** - AI-powered fuzzer with coverage-guided feedback, crash deduplication, and corpus management

Exposes all functionality via an MCP server for Claude Code integration.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install (basic)
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Install with fuzzing support
pip install -e ".[dev,fuzz]"

# Static analysis via CLI
dcs hunt /path/to/project
dcs verify --finding-ids <id1> <id2>

# Dynamic analysis (fuzzing) via CLI
dcs fuzz /path/to/target.py
dcs replay /path/to/corpus
dcs corpus /path/to/corpus
dcs fuzz-plugins
dcs report /path/to/output

# Run via MCP server
python -m deep_code_security.mcp
```

## Architecture

### Static Analysis (SAST)

```
Target Codebase
    |
    v
HUNTER     tree-sitter parse → source/sink match → taint track
    |      Output: RawFinding[] (JSON, paginated)
    v
AUDITOR    PoC generation → sandbox execution → confidence scoring
    |      Output: VerifiedFinding[] (JSON)  [Exploit = 10% bonus only]
    v
ARCHITECT  context gather → guidance generation → dependency analysis
           Output: RemediationGuidance[] (JSON)
```

### Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing)

```
Target Function
    |
    v
FUZZER     LLM-guided input generation → sandboxed execution →
           crash detection → corpus management → coverage tracking
           Output: CrashReport[] (JSON, with reproducer inputs)
```

### Supported Languages (v1)

- Python (Flask, Django patterns)
- Go (net/http, database/sql patterns)
- C (stretch goal — basic argv/stdin patterns)

## MCP Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `deep_scan_hunt` | Run Hunter phase (AST parse + taint track) |
| `deep_scan_verify` | Run Auditor phase (sandbox exploit verification) |
| `deep_scan_remediate` | Run Architect phase (remediation guidance) |
| `deep_scan_full` | Run all three phases sequentially |

## Confidence Scoring

The confidence score (0-100) uses a weighted composite:

| Factor | Weight | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Taint path completeness | 45% | Full path = 100, partial = 50, heuristic = 20 |
| Sanitizer absence | 25% | No sanitizer = 100, full sanitizer = 0 |
| CWE severity baseline | 20% | Critical = 100, High = 75, Medium = 50, Low = 25 |
| Exploit verification | 10% | **Bonus only** — failed PoC does not penalize |

Thresholds: `>=75` confirmed, `>=45` likely, `>=20` unconfirmed, `<20` false positive

## Sandbox Security Policy

Sandbox containers enforce:
- `--network=none` — no network access
- `--read-only` — read-only root filesystem
- `--tmpfs /tmp:rw,noexec,nosuid,size=64m` — writable temp with noexec
- `--cap-drop=ALL` — no Linux capabilities
- `--security-opt=no-new-privileges` — no privilege escalation
- `--security-opt seccomp=seccomp-default.json` — custom seccomp profile
- `--pids-limit=64` — no fork bombs
- `--memory=512m` — memory ceiling
- `--user=65534:65534` — run as nobody

## Development

```bash
make lint           # Lint with ruff
make test           # All tests (90%+ coverage required)
make test-hunter    # Hunter tests only
make test-auditor   # Auditor tests only
make test-architect # Architect tests only
make test-mcp       # MCP server tests only
make test-fuzzer    # Fuzzer tests only
make sast           # Security scan with bandit
make security       # sast + pip-audit
```

## Registry Format

See `registries/README.md` for the YAML registry format documentation.

## Known Limitations (v1)

1. **Intraprocedural taint only** — source and sink must be in the same function body. Expected detection rate: **10-25%** of real-world injection vulnerabilities. Most web app vulnerabilities span multiple function call boundaries and will NOT be detected by v1.

2. **Query brittleness** — tree-sitter queries match specific AST shapes. The following patterns are NOT matched in v1:
   - Aliased imports: `req = request; req.form`
   - Fully-qualified names: `flask.request.form`
   - Class attributes: `self.request.form`
   - Chained calls: `request.form.get("key")` (partial match only)

3. **PoC verification is bonus-only** — most template-based PoCs fail due to missing execution context (framework setup, dependency injection, state initialization). A failed PoC does NOT mean the vulnerability is false. The exploit bonus is capped at 10 points.

4. **No cross-language taint** — Python calling C via FFI is not analyzed. Each language is analyzed independently.

5. **No interprocedural analysis** — call graphs across functions/files are not traced in v1. Deferred to v1.1.

6. **Fuzzer requires optional dependencies** — dynamic analysis requires `pip install -e ".[fuzz]"` to install the `anthropic` SDK and related packages. The fuzzer will not be available without these dependencies.

7. **`deep_scan_fuzz` MCP tool requires Podman** — The MCP fuzzing tool uses
   ContainerBackend for full isolation and is only available when Podman is
   installed and the `dcs-fuzz-python:latest` image is built via
   `make build-fuzz-sandbox`. CLI fuzzing supports both SubprocessBackend
   (rlimits-only) and ContainerBackend.

## Security Model

The MCP server runs as a **native stdio process** on the host. It does NOT run
inside a Docker container, avoiding the Docker socket mount attack vector.
Docker or Podman is used for sandbox containers that execute exploit PoCs
(auditor/architect phases). The fuzzer's ContainerBackend uses Podman
exclusively for rootless container execution.

All file access goes through `DCS_ALLOWED_PATHS` allowlist validation with symlink resolution. All RawFinding fields are validated before exploit template interpolation. Finding provenance is verified via server-side session store (external callers cannot inject arbitrary findings).

## v1.1 Roadmap

- Interprocedural taint tracking (call graph construction)
- Java and Rust language support
- Additional registry patterns (aliased imports, fully-qualified names)
- gVisor/Firecracker sandbox option for higher-risk deployments
